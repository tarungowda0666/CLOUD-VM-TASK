# CLOUD-VM-TASK
# ☁ Task 2: Launch a Virtual Machine (VM) Instance using GitHub Codespaces

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how cloud virtual machines work by creating and connecting to a cloud-based Linux instance using GitHub Codespaces.

## 🛠 Platform Used
GitHub Codespaces 

## ⚙️ Configuration Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- **Region:** GitHub global cloud  
- **Machine Type:** Linux container 

## 🪄 Steps Performed
1. Created GitHub repository `cloud-vm-task`.  
2. Launched GitHub Codespace (browser-based VM).  
3. Ran Linux commands: `uname -a`, `whoami`, `ls`, `pwd`.  
4. Created a sample file `hello.txt` and verified output.  
5. Captured screenshots as proof of running instance and terminal access.
